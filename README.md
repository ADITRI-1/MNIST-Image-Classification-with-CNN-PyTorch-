# MNIST-Image-Classification-with-CNN-PyTorch-
This project builds and evaluates a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for handwritten digit classification using the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset is loaded strictly via torchvision.datasets.MNIST. The workflow covers dataset exploration, CNN design, training, and detailed evaluation.
